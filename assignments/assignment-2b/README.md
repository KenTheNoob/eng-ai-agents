assignment-2b.ipynb implements PatchCore and EfficientAd using Anomalib.<br>
The path to the MVTecAD dataset must be provided to the datamodule since it is too large.<br>
You may have to reload the dev container after adding the MVTecAD dataset<br>
The paper containing explainations of the models is in assignment-2b.pdf.<br>
You do not need to train the model since the trained models have alreayd been saved.<br>
The Anomalib library may require several imports in order to setup.<br>
PatchCore and EfficientAd both ended up with high AUROC scores<br>
