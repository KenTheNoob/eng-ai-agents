assignment-2b.ipynb implements PatchCore and EfficientAd using Anomalib<br>
The report is in assignment2b-report.pdf<br>
The trained models are saved in the results folder<br>
You do not need to train the model since the trained models have already been saved.<br>
The path to the MVTecAD dataset must be provided to the datamodule since it is too large<br>
You may have to reload the dev container after adding the MVTecAD dataset<br>
The Anomalib library may require several imports in order to setup<br>
PatchCore and EfficientAd both ended up with high AUROC scores<br>
