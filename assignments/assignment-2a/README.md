All equations are shown in assigment-2a.ipynb as markdown cells under the output.<br>
I created my own model by rewriting the classification task code using pytorch in model_gpu.ipynb.<br>
You do not need to train the model (takes ~30 minutes) since the result is in model_gpu.pth.<br>
My model ended up with around 85% accuracy.<br>
The code for integrated gradients and grad-CAM is in assignment-2a.ipynb<br>
The cell for grad-CAM may have to be rerun since an overconfident model causes grad-CAM to fail<br>
The code was slightly modified from the given video to work for binary classification using pytorch<br>
